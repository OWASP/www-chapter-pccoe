## Welcome

The **OWASP Student Chapter at Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering (PCCOE), Pune** is an officially recognized chapter under the [OWASP Foundation](https://owasp.org).  
Our mission is to foster a culture of security awareness, hands-on learning, and collaboration among students and aspiring security professionals.

We conduct workshops, seminars, Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions, and community events to help students understand and apply real-world cybersecurity skills.  
Our chapter serves as a bridge between academia and the cybersecurity industry — creating opportunities to learn, build, and contribute to open-source security initiatives.
